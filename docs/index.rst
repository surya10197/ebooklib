EbookLib is a Python library for managing EPUB2/EPUB3 files. It's capable of reading and writing EPUB files programmatically.

The API is designed to be as simple as possible, while at the same time making complex things possible too. It has support
for covers, table of contents, spine, guide, metadata, SMIL, pagebreaks and more. EbookLib works with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3.
